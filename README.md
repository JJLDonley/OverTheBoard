## Features

### Real Board Feed
- **URL Link**: Add your board video feed URL (usually requires embed)
- **Audio Control**: URL is intentionally left open. You will need to add a way to mute this
- **Recommendation**: Highly recommend VDO Ninja with `&noaudio` parameter
- **Alternative**: You can also mute the tab this page is on
- **Purpose**: Shows where the overhead board will go and allows review with canvas overlay

### Stone Size
- **Purpose**: Allows matching as best as possible between board and overlay
- **Function**: Interpolated between the grid points but can be set manually
- **Usage**: Adjust the stone size to match your physical board stones

### Chat Integration
- **Requirement**: Chat URL requires embedding or URL that allows iframe embedding
- **Purpose**: Provides chat overlay for viewer interaction
- **Examples**: Twitch, YouTube, Discord, or custom chat systems

### OBS Camera

### OBS WebSocket Control
- **Purpose**: Allows users to control their OBS remotely
- **Setup**: You will likely need to forward an address to the local server of OBS

## URL Parameters

### Basic Parameters
- `OTB`: Main board video URL (double-encoded). Required for viewers.
- `Chat`: Chat embed URL
- `obs`: OBS controller VDO Ninja URL (double-encoded)
- `Network`: VDO Ninja room name
- `stone`: Stone size value
- `role`: `CO` (commentator) or `VW` (viewer)
- `ai`: AI overlay context as `type/id`, e.g. `game/87480675`
- `db`: Use local AI host (`http://localhost:8080`) instead of `https://stream-ai.baduk.club`

### AI Overlay
Commentators can enter an AI context in setup, or pass it in the URL:

```txt
?ai=game/87480675
?ai=review/123456
?ai=game/87480675&db
```

Overlaytool embeds the full AI page from:

```txt
https://stream-ai.baduk.club/type/id?width=420
```

With `?db`, it embeds the local AI page instead:

```txt
http://localhost:8080/type/id?width=420
```

Commentators see it as a draggable, collapsible iframe scaled to a small readable window. Use `−` to collapse it and `□` to expand it.

### OBS Remote Control (via VDO Ninja)
- **How it works**: The OBS control panel is an embedded VDO Ninja iframe that relays OBS WebSocket controls through VDO Ninja. No direct browser-to-OBS WebSocket connection is required.
- **Scenes**: Use VDO Ninja’s built-in OBS control UI to expose scenes and stream controls.

### Grid Parameters
- `grid`: Grid corner coordinates (semicolon-separated)
### Coordinate Color
- `CC`: Coordinate label color (hex)

## Usage Examples

### Complete Setup URL
```
https://yoursite.com/?OTB=your-video-url&Chat=your-chat-url&obs=your-vdo-ninja-obs-url&Network=your-room&stone=125&role=CO
```

## Technical Notes

### OBS WebSocket Compatibility
- Supports OBS WebSocket v5.x
- Automatic authentication handling
- Fallback methods for different OBS versions
- Real-time event handling

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebSocket support
- HTTPS required for secure WebSocket connections
- Camera and microphone permissions for OBS feed

### Security Considerations
- OBS WebSocket passwords are not included in shareable URLs
- Passwords must be entered manually for security
- Scene lists are included in URLs for convenience
